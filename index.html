    <h1>Practice Git Commands</h1>
    <hr />
    <div>
      <h3>1. Creating working directory on computer</h3>
      <p>
        We create the project directory. Inside that directory right click and
        select Git Bash. To initialize our project we type in git bash console
        <span>git init</span>. After that project directory will be initialized
        for GitHub. Now we need to add our credentials , user name and user
        email. To do that we type in git bash console
        <span>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</span> and
        <span>git config --global user.email "your@email.com"</span>. This will
        associate our local files with GitHub repository.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Create some test files in project directory</h3>
      <p>
        Right click in directory and create some file, for example index.html.
        But we can also create file from git bash console, to do that we type
        <span> touch name-of-the-file.extension.</span> This command should
        create new file.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Checking status</h3>
      <p>
        To check status simply type in git bash <span>git status</span>. This
        will show current status of files.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Before we continue...</h3>
      <p>
        Now it is important to understand that all files are tracked in stages.
        First we have a working directory with files. Then we need to add them,
        prepare them. To prepare files we type <span>git add . </span>. This
        will prepare all files in directory. If we want seperate files to be
        added we type <span>git add myFile.extension</span>. Now in the first
        command we used <strong>dot</strong>, to tell that we want all files to
        prepare. Just to be sure in what is going on we will type
        <span>git status</span>. This is good practice to be aware of process.
        Next thing is to commit those files. To do that we type
        <span
          >git commit -m "comment , message , short description of changes we
          made."</span
        >. Again we check our status <span>git status</span>.
      </p>
      <h3>5. GitHub Repository</h3>
      <p>
        Create your GitHub repository under your GitHub account. This will be
        place where we put our files. Now we need to clone our project, and to
        do that we type <span>git clone URL-LOCATION-OF-REPOSITORY</span>.
      </p>
